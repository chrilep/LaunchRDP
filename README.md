# LaunchRDP

> AI totally messed up my README. I will write a better one later.

LaunchRDP is a launcher for Remote Desktop Connections on Windows 10+ (it needs an installed webview2).

It manages users and hosts, windows sizes and positions.

I coded it to replace mRemoteNG which still uses legacy ActiveX and did not release any prod releasy since 2019.
