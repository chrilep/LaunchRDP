# LaunchRDP
LaunchRDP is a credential and host manager built with Go + Fyne. It securely stores user/password pairs and host definitions, then dynamically generates .rdp files with all supported settings and launches sessions directly via mstsc, making it easy to manage multiple RDP connections without juggling static files.
